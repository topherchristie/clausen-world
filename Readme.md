## My idea for clausenworld.com ##

Clausen let his domain name expire so I bought it. This is the site I put on http://www.clausenworld.com while I owned it. 
It took him several months to figure out this site was there.  He has since bought it back from me with scotch and beer.

My only other Idea was a 'Shun On' and 'Shun Off' voting site.  Maybe next time.
